# ENEM Provas GUI

This project aims to provide a graphical user interface for accessing data from the [ENEM API by yunger7](https://github.com/yunger7/enem-api)

This project is in development, and the plans for it's MVP currently are:

- [x] List all exams
- [ ] Solve questions from exams by:
  - [ ] Whole exam
  - [ ] Whole exam by language
  - [ ] Only specific disciplines
  - [ ] Random question

This project is being developed using SvelteKit, and it's main purpose is learning and (with some luck) helping someone some day.

The project depends strongly on bootstrap for it's styling, I'm not that great with CSS so that's the path I'm following.
